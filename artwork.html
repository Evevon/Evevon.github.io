            <h1> Eve's Artworks </h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to my artwork page! I often make my drawings on the computer,
                but I also use simple pencil and paper whenever I am traveling.
                I love to use colours in my work. My favorite thing to draw are
                people, and characters from the stories I work on.
            </p>
            <h3> Digital Artworks </h3>
            <p>
                Here is a selection of my latest digital artworks. I use Paint
                tool Sai as painting software. When working digitally, I like to
                simulate a paintlike style in my artwork. A very huge advantage of
                the computer is that I have a lot of colours and brushes to
                choose from. That's why a lot of my art is digitally created!
